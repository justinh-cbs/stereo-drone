# lildrone

Little project to play with drones with stereo cameras.

TODO:

  - actually simulate simple quadrotor dynamics
  - output imu
  - open loop sim
  - make state estimator
  - later add commands
  - separate threads for multiwii sim and depth / other sensors (forward rangefinder)
  - make structure diagram
  - CAD model for camera holder (use old style camera for now)
  - play with opencv to try and get depth map

Instructions for setting up the pi, flight controller, and sensors - assuming you have connected
the "normal drone" stuff (power dist, motors, etc.) already.

The pi communicates with the flight controller over GPIO 14 (TXD) and 15 (RXD). Wire 14 to the
RX of one of the flight controller's UARTs, and 15 to the TX so you have TX -> RX on both (I used
the UART marked TX5/RX5 on the Mamba, corresponding to UART 4 in betaflight?)

11/6 Edit:
Switched to using UART2 on pi, corresponding to GPIO 0 (TX) and 1 (RX)
TX5/RX5 on the Mamba corresponds to UART 5 in iNav

Once connected, set that UART to Serial RX in Betaflight, and from the main settings page set
the receiver to MSP.

Pi setup attempt 11/6:
Detailing all the steps I take, so we can reproduce or at least know what not to do...
Flashed Raspbian to SD card
Edited wpa_supplicant for wifi
Booted up pi
Updated with:
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt update all

Following YAMSPy setup instruction:
    git clone https://github.com/ricardodeazambuja/YAMSPy.git
    cd YAMSPy
    sudo pip3 install .

Add pi user to dialout to access serial port
    sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER

Disable serial console, enable UART:
    sudo raspi-config
    interface options -> Serial Port -> No -> Yes

Add UARTs to /boot/config:
    sudo nano /boot/config.txt
add to this file:
    enable_uart=1
    dtoverlay=uart2,alt=0 
        (maybe don't need alt=0? that might be wrong but it works)
in YAMSPy files set serial to:
    "/dev/ttyAMA1"

Flash iNav firmware with Mamba405US I2C version, version without I2C doesn't work!
In iNAV:
    in ports:
        set UART5 to MSP
    in receiver:
        set receiver mode to MSP
    these tabs don't seem to work on Mac, have to use linux laptop. maybe update iNav version?

this worked!!!

To get gpio readall to work:
    cd /tmp
    wget https://project-downloads.drogon.net/wiringpi-latest.deb
    sudo dpkg -i wiringpi-latest.deb

TODO:
add details of how to enable serial port on pi
figure out connecting sensors to flight controller and document here
